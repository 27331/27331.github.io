    <pre>      INTRODUCTION
      Brain damage appears in many forms but none so prominent as in Agron Ray. This essay is a deep dive into the nature of brain damage in Agron Ray and the numerous ways it is shown in his actions.
      
      AGRON RAY HIMSELF
      Agron Ray can be quantified and characterized by the movies he watches. His character traits are drawn from characters in such movies and shows as Borat, The big lez show and Freddy Got Fingered. He is a proud and devoted catholic (though he seldom ever attends church) and a proud irishman. His pastimes include bike rides, bullying Jack Booker and mocking the LGBTQ+ community.
      
      HOW IS HIS BRAIN DAMAGE SHOWN?
      Agron Ray's brain damage can be split into 2 categories.
        1. VERBAL:
           Agron is known for his opinions, they are often right wing and fail to stand on their own. His arguments are taken from movies doing satire of the topic he is arguing and as a result the people around him lose the debate as they are too confused to form a coherent argument.
        2. PHYSICAL:
           Agron also suffers from numerous disabilities as a result of being oxygen starved as a baby as well as (anecdotally) being dropped on his head as a child. These issues include but are not limited to an inability to catch a ball as well as a form of numerical dyslexia wherein the numbers move around on the page when he is in a state of mental or physical fatigue.
      
      HIS BODY
      Agron is often known as a hulking behemoth by his peers due to his large stature. He stands at around 6 ft 5 and is able to swiftly eliminate any threats with his enormous mass due to his growing beer belly. He also possesses enormous lips and a fantastic afro, all accompanied by a neckbeard envied by many in the anime community.
      
      CONCLUSION
      Agron Ray is a victim of brain damage but perhaps it is not too late to help him, what happens next lies in our hands.
